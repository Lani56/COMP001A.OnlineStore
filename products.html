            <p>Jade Plant - A perfect succulent for home!Thrives in indirect sunlight, typically south facing or west facing window is ideal providing at least 4 to 6 hours of light daily. They can reach heights of 3 to 6 ft indoors and may produce clusters of small white or pink flowers. With proper care they can live for decades, up to 70 years! Jade plants do prefer warm conditions and should be kept in temperatures above 50F(10C). If you plan to grow outdoors they need to be kept in mild climates(zones 10 and above) but need to be brought in during colder months.Use well draining soil, such as cactus or succulent potting mix it helps prevent root rot! Sadly jade plants are susceptible to root rot.Mixing in perlite or sand can improve drainage. Make sure to water the plant thoroughly during growing seasons(spring and summer). Also, allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings and in the dormant season(fall and winter), reduce watering to about once a month. By over-watering it can lead to root rot.WARNING!!if you have pets it can be toxic if ingested, please keep out of reach of animals. Can also cause skin irritation in some individuals.</p>

This plant thrives in bright, indirect sunlight, and well draining soil. It's also well suited to typical indoor temperatures! Aloe vera also helps purify indoor air by releasing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide at night which can improve air quality. To prevent root rot water when the soil is completely dry and reduce watering during the winter when the plant is dormant. WARNING!! Aloe Vera is mildly toxic if ingested by pets.</p>
            <img src="/images/moth.jpg" alt="type of Orchid">
            <p>Moth Orchid (Phalaenopsis) - This flower is a popular easy to grow houseplant! Moth orchids are native to tropical Asian habitats but you can grow them in the U.S. They need warm, humid climates so if you don't live in southern tip of Florida they cannot grow outside.For moth orchids to grow indoors they need to be place in a pot filled with orchid bark miz or sphagnum moss. These plants prefer bright, indirect light, ideally from east or north facing windows. Moth orchids are sensitive to over-watering and should be water when the bark or moss is dry to touch. If you want to grow them outside then it's essential to mimic their natural habitat as closely as possible so, warm, humid areas with protection from strong winds and direct sunlight. If you have pets moth orchids are considered non-toxic so if your pet ingests them it is unlikely to suffer from any adverse reactions. However, it's best to keep them away from the plant because the plant may be treated with pesticides or fertilizers that could be harmful if ingested.</p>
            <img src="/images/lavender.png" alt="Herbaceous perennial plant">
            <p>Lavender - This plant can be grown outdoors or indoors! Lavender can come as a bush, tree, and even has dwarf varieties. If you choose to grow outdoors the best time to plant is in the spring after the last frost or in early fall in milder climates which allows the plant to establish roots before winter. It thrives in well-draining, sandy, or gravelly soil with a slight alkaline pH(avoid heavy clay soils that retain moisture as lavender is prone to root rot). Make sure to choose a location that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Having full sun is crucial for healthy growth and abundant blooms. Lavender doesn't require much fertilization and grows best in poor soils, so avoid adding fertilizer unless necessary. Generally lavender is resistant to pest but watch for aphids and spittlebugs. Now if you're choosing to grow in doors make sure to place you lavender near a south facing window where it can receive at least 3-4 hours of direct sunlight daily. Use well draining soil, slightly alkaline or neutral to prevent root rot and water the plant only when the top inch of soil is dry. Make sure to maintain moderate temperatures and low humidity levels, as lavender thrives in warmer, dryer climates.</p>
