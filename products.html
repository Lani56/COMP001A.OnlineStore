            <p>Jade Plant - A perfect succulent for home!Thrives in indirect sunlight, typically south facing or west facing window is ideal providing at least 4 to 6 hours of light daily. They can reach heights of 3 to 6 ft indoors and may produce clusters of small white or pink flowers. With proper care they can live for decades, up to 70 years! Jade plants do prefer warm conditions and should be kept in temperatures above 50F(10C). If you plan to grow outdoors they need to be kept in mild climates(zones 10 and above) but need to be brought in during colder months.Use well draining soil, such as cactus or succulent potting mix it helps prevent root rot! Sadly jade plants are susceptible to root rot.Mixing in perlite or sand can improve drainage. Make sure to water the plant thoroughly during growing seasons(spring and summer). Also, allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings and in the dormant season(fall and winter), reduce watering to about once a month. By over-watering it can lead to root rot.WARNING!!if you have pets it can be toxic if ingested, please keep out of reach of animals. Can also cause skin irritation in some individuals.</p>
